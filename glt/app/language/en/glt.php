		"The omnibus crime bill, known as the Safe Streets and Communities act, proposed a number of changes to the Canadian legal system, many of them directly affecting anyone looking for a pardon. In addition to other changes, this act removed the term “pardon” and replaced it with “record suspension.” As well, the process - and your eligibility to receive a record suspension - were made increasingly difficult. Despite an outraged public, the bill received royal assent on March 13, 2012"

		"1"=>"A 'Record Suspension' is the same as a 'Pardon'. Recently, the Canadian government replaced the term 'Pardon' with 'Record Suspension' when they made changes to the Criminal Records Act. It's generally accepted that the name change was intended to show more respect to the victims of crime who may not feel justice in the word 'Pardon'.",
		"2"=>"Regardless of which term you use, 'Pardon' or 'Record Suspension', the effect is the same: your criminal record is permanently sealed from the public record, essentially giving you a fresh start at living life as if you didn't have a criminal record.",

		"1"=>array(
			"question"=>"What is a Pardon?",
			"answer"=>"A Canadian Pardon (also known as a \"Record Suspension\"), is granted by the government of Canada to indicate that your criminal record has been separated from publicly visible criminal charges in the national criminal record database.  When you receive a Pardon, no one can view your criminal record unless they get written permission from you or the Public Safety Minister of Canada. In summary, a Pardon gives you a fresh start at your criminal record.",
		),
		"2"=>array(
			"question"=>"What are the Benefits of a Pardon?",
			"answer"=>"A criminal record can negatively affect your life in a number of ways. A record can make it more difficult to find a job, get a promotion, travel abroad, do volunteer work, enroll in education programs, immigrate, get custody of a child, rent an apartment and much more.  The ability to seal your criminal record from public foresight is a privilege truly unique to Canada – the vast majority of criminal record holders elsewhere in the world must live with the full consequences of their record for the rest of their lives.",
		),
		"3"=>array(
			"question"=>"How Long Will it Take to Get a Pardon?",
			"answer"=>"You can expect a total processing time of approximately 6-18 months. Factors which can affect the total timeline include the length and complexity of your record, as well as the number of places you were charged.<br><br>Each application must go through a specific nine (9) step legal process as specified by the Criminal Records Act in Canada. If any one of these steps is completed incorrectly or in the wrong timeline your application can be delayed for a significant amount of time or even become void.<br><br>Once your application has been completed by Canadian Wide Pardons, it will be submitted to the Canadian Parole Board for their independent review and decision. Canada Wide Pardons has a proven and systematic system to compile your application in the shortest amount of time.",
		),
		"4"=>array(
			"question"=>"Can You Guarantee My Pardon?",

However, using an highly experienced accredited application firm like Canada Wide Pardons can maximize your opportunity for success.",
		),
		"5"=>array(
			"question"=>"What's the Total Cost of a Pardon?",

		"6"=>array(
