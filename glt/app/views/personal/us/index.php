									<p>
										For American Green card holders and all US citizens living and working abroad, it is mandatory to file a US tax return. 
										Green card holders and all US citizens are required to file a US return, no matter where they live, as long as their income (earned in the US and abroad) is just over $9,000. 
										Many people wrongly assume that because they have never owed money to the IRS, they simply don't have to file.
										Earning anything over $9,350 does require you to file, however. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The US has treaties with many foreign countries that will reduce or even eliminate actual owed tax. 
										You cannot take advantage of these benefits if you don't file.
									</p>
									<p>
										Taxpayers may also have to file a state return in addition to a federal return depending on which state you have moved from. 
										Each US state sets its own rules regarding state taxes and expats. 
										Some states demand that you file a state return, while others release you when you move away.
									</p>
									<p>
										At Global Link Tax, we will explain difficult US tax situations to you in simple and concise language. 
										We will help you fulfill your US tax filing obligations to the IRS and ensure its done property. 
										At Global Link, our principal accountant Mr. Yeung is a US Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and has helped many expats living in Canada file their Canadian and US tax returns.
