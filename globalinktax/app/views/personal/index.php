											As a Canadian resident, temporary worker in Canada, student studying in Canada, person with income in Canada, visitor with property in Canada, you have to file a Canadian tax return. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Tax Residents of Canada are subject to Canadian income tax on their world income. 
											World income includes employment income, income from self-employment, income from investments, rental income, taxable capital gains, etc.
										</p>
										<p>
											For individuals, the income tax return for the prior year is due April 30 of the following year e.g. for the 2014 tax year, your income tax return is due April 30, 2015. 
											It is best to file well before this date no matter what situation you are in. 
											1) if you are entitled to a refund, it will ensure you get your refund sooner rather than later 
											2) if you are entitled to Federal GST and Ontario Trillium Benefits, filing on time will ensure you get those benefits according to the government timeline 
											3) if you are owing taxes, it helps you avoid penalties for late filing, and helps you determine how much you owe and to create a plan to pay the amount owing.
										</p>
										<p>
											(June 15 if self-employed or the spouse of a self-employed) following each calendar year. 
											Quarterly installments of income tax are required in some circumstances. 
											Canada Customs and Revenue Agency will advise on these circumstances on an individual basis.
